# Local Search Engine in Rust

**THIS SOFTWARE IS UNFINISHED!!! Don't have any high expectations.**

## Quick Start

```console
$ cargo run serve ./folder/
$ iexplore.exe http://localhost:6969/
```

## TODO

- search result should be clickable -> easy to open it ? ( is it possible to do it inside wsl )
- Hot reloading? [inotify](https://docs.rs/inotify/latest/inotify/)
- windows executable?
